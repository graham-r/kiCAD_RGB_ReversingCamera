# A&R A60 Amplifier KICAD projects

Version 8.01 differences

Compact style PCB
Power & speaker fuses removed
Common input socket (Left & Right)
+/-36v Power rails decoupled between power amp stage & input stage


NOTE: These are experiments in using KICAD - they are untested as they have not been built
(unless stated otherwise in the README file in a specific directory).

The projects contained in this repository are all based on the A&R A60 or A60AP integrated
amplifiers, currently limited to issue 8 (25502 onwards schematics).

The copyright of the circuits remain with the original owners, the Schematic and hardware
copyright are open source.
